Project Title: Single Axis Solar Tracking System with Arduino-Based Speed Sensing Speed Breaker

Overview:
This project integrates a single axis solar tracking system with an Arduino controlled speed sensing speed breaker to promote renewable energy usage and enhance road safety. The solar tracking mechanism improves the efficiency of solar energy generation by continuously aligning the solar panel with the sun. The harvested energy powers the automated speed breaker system, which adjusts according to vehicle speed.

Objective:
To combine intelligent automation with renewable energy to reduce power consumption and improve traffic safety through a responsive speed control system.

Working Principle:
The solar panel is mounted on a motor-driven frame that rotates to track the sun’s movement during the day, ensuring maximum energy absorption. The generated power is stored and supplied to an Arduino microcontroller. Sensors such as ultrasonic or IR sensors detect vehicle speed. If the vehicle is within a safe speed range, the breaker remains flat. If the vehicle exceeds the limit, the breaker raises automatically to slow it down.
